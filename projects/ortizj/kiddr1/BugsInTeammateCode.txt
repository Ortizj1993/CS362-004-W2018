Title: Smithy card 

Project: kiddr1/dominion
Version: Riam Sangdoung assignment 2 submission

Reported by: Jesus Ortiz
Email: ortizj@oregonstate.edu
Created: 3/4/2018

Type: Bug
Status: Open
Priority: Major
Resolution: Not resolved
Affected Version: Riam Sangdoung assignment 2 submission
File name: dominion.c
Environment: MAC OS sierra, GCC C Compiler, flip.oregonstate.edu
Description: The number of cards that a player is supposed to draw when Smithy is played is 3 cards. It appear that the number of cards actually drawn is 2 cards.

Code causing Bug:
playSmithy function has an iterative loop that draws cards from the deck. The counter of this loop executes for numbers 0 and 1. That is 1 iteration less than required to draw 3 cards.

Suggested Fix:
Change the ‘<=’ operator in the counter condition to ‘<’ to add 1 more iteration and draw another card.
